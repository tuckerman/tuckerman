Hi there! My name is Cameron (he/him) and I'm a Software Engineer/Site Reliability Engineer interested in ML infra, reliability/scalability of distributed systems, and equitable incident response.

I'm currently a member at [South Park Commons](https://southparkcommons.com) and previously worked as a SWE/SRE at [Everyday Robots](https://everydayrobots.com), [X](https://x.company), Google, and Airbnb.

I love to chat about reliability/monitoring/infratrsture/oncall/etc! I can be reached at cameron [at] ctuck.com.
