Hi there! My name is Cameron and I'm an engineer interested ininterested in the intersection of AI, Robotics, and Large-Scale Distributed Systems. I'm currently an engineer at [Wayve](https://wayve.ai) on our Machine Learning Horizons team.

Previously I've worked as a SWE/SRE on robotics and infrastructure at Google X, Google, and Airbnb. I'm also an alumni of South Park Commons.
