Hi there! My name is Cameron and I'm an engineer interested in the intersection of AI, Robotics, and Distributed Systems. I'm currently at [Wayve](https://wayve.ai) on our Science team (we are [hiring](https://wayve.ai/careers/join-us/?location=Mountain%20View&department=Science)).

Previously I've worked as an engineer on both robotics and infrastructure teams at [X, the moonshot factory](http://x.company), [Google](https://google.com), and [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com). I'm also an alumni of [South Park Commons](https://southparkcommons.com).
