 I am an engineer interested in the intersection of AI, Robotics, and Large-Scale Distributed Systems. Currently, I manage a team focused on data search and understanding at Wayve. I was previously the tech lead for foundation model development.

I have worked at Alphabet (Google, Google X, Everyday Robots), Airbnb, Sherwin-Williams, and I am an alumnus of South Park Commons where I founded General Reliability. I am also an angel investor and previously have advised/consulted for a number of SaaS/infrastructure startups.
