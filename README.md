Hi there! My name is Cameron and I'm an engineer interested interested in the intersection of AI, Robotics, and Large-Scale Distributed Systems. I'm currently an engineer at [Wayve](https://wayve.ai) on our Machine Learning Horizons team.

Previously I've worked as an engineer on robotics and infrastructure teams at Google[x], Google, and Airbnb. I'm also an alumni of [South Park Commons](https://southparkcommons.com).
