Hi there! My name is Cameron and I'm a Software Engineer/Site Reliability Engineer interested in ML infra, reliability/scalability of distributed systems, and equitable incident response. I'm the founder and principal engineer at [General Reliability](https://generalreliability.com) where we build tools for managing production and responding to incidents for teams of all sizes.

Previously I've worked as a SWE/SRE at [Everyday Robots](https://everydayrobots.com), [X, the moonshot factory](https://x.company), Google, and Airbnb.

I love to chat about reliability/monitoring/infratrsture/oncall/etc! I can be reached at cameron-at-ctuck.com or check me out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tuckerman) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.ctuck.com/@tuckerman).
