Hi there! My name is Cameron and I'm a Software Engineer/Site Reliability Engineer interested ininterested in the intersection of AI, Robotics, and Large-Scale Distributed Systems. I'm currently a software engineer at [Wayve](https://wayve.ai).

Previously I've worked as a SWE/SRE at X (the moonshot factory), Google, and Airbnb. I'm also an alumni of South Park Commons where I founded General Reliability.

I love to chat about reliability/monitoring/infratrsture/oncall/etc! I can be reached at cameron-at-ctuck.com or check me out on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@tuckerman).
