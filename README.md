Hi there! My name is Cameron and I'm a Software Engineer/Site Reliability Engineer interested in ML infra, reliability/scalability of distributed systems, and equitable incident response. I'm the founder at [General Reliability](https://generalreliability.com) where we build tools for managing production and responding to incidents for teams of all sizes.

Previously I've worked as a SWE/SRE at X (the moonshot factory), Google, and Airbnb.

I love to chat about reliability/monitoring/infratrsture/oncall/etc! I can be reached at cameron-at-ctuck.com or check me out on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@tuckerman).
