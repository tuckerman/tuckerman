Hi there! My name is Cameron (he/him) and I'm a Software Engineer @  [X](https://x.company) where I work on [The Everyday Robot Project](https://x.company/projects/everyday-robots/). I previously worked at Google and Airbnb, both in both the capacities of Software Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer. I am passionate and love talking about incident response, scalability/efficiency, and monitoring/observability.
