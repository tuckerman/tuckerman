Hi there! My name is Cameron (he/him) and I'm a Software Engineer @  [X](https://x.company) where I work on robotics.. I previously worked at Google and Airbnb, both in the capacities of Software Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer. I'm excited about incident response, reliability, and efficiency and love to chat about them!
